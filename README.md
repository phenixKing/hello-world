# hello-world
Just a repository,my first repository
I am a junior programmar and I've worked in three companies in the pssed 5 years . Maybe its a little late to have my first git program , this should blam to my bad English. For I lives in a Contry which is not using English as mother language . I learn English all by myself .It's a little hards for me . So ,too much to say ,but short of time .I don't know if I've expressed myself correct(in programmar ) ,I've tried my best .God bless everyone.
